# Neural Style Transfer Project

## Overview
This project explores three major Neural Style Transfer (NST) methods:

1. **Gatys et al. (2016)** - Optimization-based NST, high quality but slow.
2. **Johnson et al. (2016)** - Per-style feed-forward NST, real-time speed but fixed style per model.
3. **Huang & Belongie (2017) AdaIN** - Arbitrary style transfer in real-time with Adaptive Instance Normalization.

The project compares these methods in terms of **quality, speed, and flexibility**. A simple and interactive **Streamlit web app** was developed to allow users to try out NST without coding.

## Features
- Implementation of three NST methods (Gatys, Johnson, AdaIN).
- Training and inference scripts for Johnson and AdaIN models.
- Pre-trained model checkpoints included (`decoder_final.pth`, Johnson models).
- **Streamlit UI**:
  - Upload content and style images.
  - Choose between methods.
  - Adjust **Î± slider** for style strength (AdaIN).
  - Download results or preview directly in the app.
- Evaluation using both objective metrics (SSIM, LPIPS, runtime) and subjective survey feedback.

##Usage

The easiest way to try the project is through the Streamlit web app:

[ðŸ”— Open the NST App](https://final-project-nst-wyky6a4shqkzp7yp5yp9vs.streamlit.app/)

Upload a content image and a style image (or a trained module for Johnson).

Choose one of the three methods: Johnson or AdaIN.

Adjust parameters (e.g., style strength for AdaIN).

View the stylized output directly and download it if you want.

---

## Evaluation
- **Objective metrics**: SSIM, LPIPS, runtime, memory usage.
- **Subjective evaluation**: small user survey comparing visual quality and control.

---

## Results Summary
- **Gatys**: Best detail, but extremely slow (minutes per image).
- **Johnson**: Real-time, but one model per style.
- **AdaIN**: Real-time + arbitrary style images, good balance of quality and speed.
